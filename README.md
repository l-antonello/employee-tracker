# employee-tracker

Developers frequently have to create interfaces that allow non-developers to easily view and interact with information stored in databases. These interfaces are called **content management systems (CMS)**. This is a command-line application from scratch to manage a company's employee database, using [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en), [Inquirer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer/v/8.2.4#installation), and [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/).
