# employee-tracker

Developers frequently have to create interfaces that allow non-developers to easily view and interact with information stored in databases. These interfaces are called **content management systems (CMS)**. This is a command-line application from scratch to manage a company's employee database, using (Node.js)[https://nodejs.org/en], (Inquirer)[https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer/v/8.2.4#installation], and (MySQL)[https://www.mysql.com/].
